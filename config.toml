Our objective is to combine the experience and knowledge of field epidemiologists, public health officers, methodologists and software developers to identify future directions and priorities in the development and dissemination of outbreak analytic tools. We will discuss the potential and limitations of statistics and modelling for informing outbreak response, and the role novel tools can play as a component of the next generation of field epidemiology training programmes.</p><p>The event will be running over 2 days, 22-23 March 2018. The full programme is available <a href='https://recon-gathering-march2018.netlify.com/files/programme.pdf'>here</a>. The first day will be a symposium giving an overview of the activities of our community, focussing on the role of modelling and analytics for informing outbreak response. The second day will consist in two parallel sessions, including a working group on field epidemiology training resources, and a community-driven hackathon. Click <a href='https://github.com/RECON-gathering-March-2018/projects'>here</a> to discuss existing projects or propose new ones. The entire event will be hosted in the <a href='https://www.accorhotels.com/gb/hotel-6455-novotel-london-paddington/index.shtml'>Novotel Paddington</a></p>"
